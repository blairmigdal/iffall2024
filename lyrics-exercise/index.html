        <p>
            Well, did my parents know better?
        </p>

        <p>
            No, but they tried

            'Cause we all need

        <p> 
            A sense of lore sometimes
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Like I need a silent mind
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In a consumer flood
        </p>
            
        <p>
            And if I'm lucky
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Maybe a glass of wine
        </p>
            
        <p>
            And if I'm lucky
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Maybe a hand next to mine
        </p>
            
        <p>
            No, if we don't know better

            No, will we try?
        </p>
                
    <div class="line"></div>

        <p>
            If I get lucky
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Maybe a simple life
        </p>
       
        <p>
            If I get lucky
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Maybe some free time
        </p>

        <p>
            No, if we don't know better

        <p>
            If we don't know better

        <p>
            Well, did my parents' parents know better, better?
