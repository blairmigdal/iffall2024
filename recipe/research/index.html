        <h5>
            Chocolate lava cakes gained popularity in the late 1990s thanks to the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and they have stuck around on dessert menus for good reason: They are rich chocolate cake and velvety sauce all in one, and they are surprisingly easy to make in under an hour. If you like to plan ahead, you can prepare the batter a day in advance, refrigerate it, then pop the cake into the oven when you are ready for dessert. This recipe, made in a 10-ounce baking dish, is meant for sharing, but you can also make it in two 6-ounce ramekins. Just cut the baking time to 7 to 9 minutes. Also, be sure to use chopped chocolate bars or chocolate fèves rather than chocolate chips here. Chips are made with stabilizers that inhibit melting and will negatively affect the texture of your dessert.

            Ingredients
        </h2>

        <h5>3 ounces/85 grams bittersweet chocolate, 70 to 74 percent cacao (not chips), chopped (about ½ cup) </h5>
        <h5>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes, plus more for the ramekin</h5>
        <h5>3 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus more for the ramekin</h5>
        <h5>1 large egg</h5>
        <h5>1 large egg yolk</h5>
        <h5>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</h5>
        <h5>⅛ teaspoon kosher salt</h5>
        <h5>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</h5>
        <h5>Confectioners’ sugar, to serve (optional)</h5>

        <h2>
            Equipment Required
        </h2>

        <h5> 2 ramekins (small cynlindrical dishes with straight sides for individual portions) </h5>
        <h5>1 large heat safe bowl to melt chocolate</h5>
        <h5>Whisk</h5>
        <h5>Spatula</h5>


        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h4>Step 1</h4>

        <p> Heat oven to 425 degrees and butter a 10-ounce ramekin. Dust the buttered ramekin with granulated sugar. </p>

        <h4>Step 2</h4>

        <p>Combine the chocolate and 3 tablespoons butter in a heat-safe bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth. (Alternatively, combine in a bowl and microwave in 30-second blasts, stirring in between, until melted and smooth, about 1 minute.) Remove from the heat and set aside. </p>

        <h4>Step 3</h4>

        <p>In a medium bowl, combine the 3 tablespoons sugar, egg, egg yolk, vanilla and salt. Whisk vigorously until the mixture is thick, foamy and pale, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the flour until smooth.</p>
        
        <h4>Step 4</h4>

        <p>Using a spatula, add the chocolate to the egg mixture and stir gently until combined.</p>

        <h4>Step 5</h4>

        <p>Pour the mixture into the ramekin. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until the edges are set and puffed, but the center is still soft when lightly pressed. (You can also cover and refrigerate the batter up to a day in advance. Add an additional minute or 2 to baking time if you are baking the cake directly from the refrigerator.)</p>

        <h4>Step 6</h4>

        <p>Use an offset spatula or small knife to loosen the edges of the cake from the ramekin. Place a plate over the ramekin and carefully invert the warm cake. Use an oven mitt or clean kitchen towel to remove the ramekin, dust the cake with confectioners’ sugar and serve immediately with ice cream or whipped cream. You can also store these in the fridge for up to three days or in the freezer for up to one month. </p>

        <p>
            I like NASA's website because the articles are organized with a good balance of white space, imagery, and text. The length of the article being labeled is a nice touch as well so the reader knows what to expect. The sidebars and sections are understandable and I am able to navigate the website without getting lost.

            This website has nice and cohesive branding through high quality imagery that focuses on the products sold. I like how they added a fun cursor as well which leans into the organic and natural elements of their branding. The website is simple without too many frills and distraction. This layout allows the viewer to clearly see their products and their quality.

            I like this website because it has a clear system that creates cohesion and clarity for the view. The color palette of grey, white, yellow, black, and red simplifies the website and makes certain areas pop. I like how they use buttons and sections to create hierarchy and it feels pretty easy to navigate.
